I created a web-based escape room as a Christmas gift, inspired by The Phantom of the Opera.
This project is a fully interactive HTML-based escape room, created as a Christmas gift. Inspired by The Phantom of the Opera, the experience is a simulation designed by the creator, where Christine acts as a systems architect who has created two AI characters: Erik and Raoul.

The participant, Falk, navigates through seven complex enigmas embedded in the simulation, solving each puzzle to restore balance between the AI characters and progress the story.

The experience culminates in a three-page web narrative, where Christine speaks directly to Falk:

Introducing the story and acknowledging his journey through the simulation.

Revealing Christine’s secrets and inner reflections, deepening immersion.

Closing the experience with an intimate message, guiding Falk to witness the story in the real world.

The project combines interactive HTML puzzles, immersive storytelling, and web design, with careful attention to:

Narrative flow and continuity

Voice consistency of Christine

Visual coherence (burgundy backgrounds, elegant typography, evocative imagery)

Mobile-friendly layout

This is a personal, immersive, and fully playable digital escape room, blending narrative, interactivity, and design in a single experience.
